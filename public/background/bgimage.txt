The background image needs to be saved to this directory as bg.jpg or bg.png. 

Since I can't directly download the attached image, please:
1. Save the image you shared with us to this directory as bg.jpg
2. Make sure it's named exactly as "bg.jpg" or "bg.png"
3. If it's already in a different format, you may need to convert it first

After saving the image, you can delete this text file.
